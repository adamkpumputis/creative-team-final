# SPD 911 Incident Response
For our final project we created an interactive application to display information about the [Seattle Police Department's 911 Incident Response](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Seattle-Police-Department-911-Incident-Response/3k2p-39jp) dataset, filtered for certain crimes and limited to observations from 2012 for size purposes.

## About the Project

This project uses R and Shiny to process and display information from the dataset. It includes an interactive map of Seattle with a widget to let the user filter for crime type and an about page that features high level observations about the dataset, as well as a histogram counting the number of times each crime appeared.

When making this project, the target audience we had in mind were people that wanted to move to Seattle. Theoretically, they would be able to use our application to learn more about crime across Seattle and then decide the best location for themselves. This audience includes out-of-state students, business owners, as well as anybody else interested in learning about crime in Seattle.

We also sought to answer the following questions in our project. If you're interested in learning the answer, feel free to check out our 'About' tab in the application!

1. What kinds of crimes occur in each region?
2. What is the most common crime overall?
3. Are certain types of crime (robbery, etc) more common in certain areas?
